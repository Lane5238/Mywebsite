NEO, formally known as AntShares, are growing in a significantly high speed.

AntShares(NEO)&#8217;s ICO started on July 9, 2016. When it was started, it&#8217;s vision is to be the distributed ledger protocol that digitalizes real-world assets. In 2017Q3, it rebranded to NEO, which aims for smart economy with digital assets, digital identity and smart contract. Many people described it as China&#8217;s Ethereum plus Ripple. Not only Chinese investors and Chinese government believe it, but also many overseas investor are pouring heavy investment into it. In only 1 year, it grew from nobody to the 9th in the cryptocurrency capital market.

From a technology aspect, blockchain is not a new word. It has been there for near 10 years. With the rapid development of information storage technology and computing power, reliable distributed systems with high performance seems to have a chance to make a huge revolution. After Bitcoin, Ethereum came and brought the idea of smart contract, which can make it much easier to build a decentralized applications. However, unfortunately the bar of building a dAPP on Ethereum is relatively high. Its smart contract uses Solidity and it&#8217;s obviously not a popular programming language. On the other hand, the security and reliability of Ethereum are doubted frequently after the DAO. NEO also supports smart contract. But the difference is it supports many popular programming languages, such as C#, Java, VB.net etc. This brings a big potential community and lowers the bar to develop dAPPs.

Speaking of business, there&#8217;re many use cases. It can improve workflow and real-time visibility on shipments status, create better performance in asset management, guarantee the safety and reliability in food supply chain and so on. Besides the big blockchain organizations, many big companies are investing in blockchain, like IBM&#8217;s Hyperledger and SAP&#8217;s Leonardo. NEO started in China, where there&#8217;s a great dynamic business market and innovative environment for it to grow fast.

In terms of policy, it may sounds like a little bit of conspiracy. In late 2017, Chinese government_ _prohibited Bitcoin and many other major cryptocurrencies. Weirdly, Chinese market made up to 90 percent of global Bitcoin trading volume between 2014 and January 2017. While the fiat was happening, Beijing central bank quietly announced that they were working on a blockchain project. I&#8217;m not inferring the relationship between NEO and government. Chinese one-party situation does have its positive effect. They make policy and regulation fast and let the things happen fast. There&#8217;re evidences like Alibaba, ofo, Mobike etc. They won&#8217;t deny the influence of policy from Chinese government.

I&#8217;m not sure about the future of NEO and blockchain. But there&#8217;s a satisfying possibility. Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong.
